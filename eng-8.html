                    Swami Vivekananda spoke these words before leaving for America in 1893. He was preparing to attend

                    He meant the spiritual knowledge, teachings of Vedanta, tolerance, and universal brotherhood that

                    For Vivekananda, it gave him worldwide recognition as a great spiritual leader. For others,
                    especially in the West, it opened the door to Hindu philosophy, yoga, and the idea of religious
                    tolerance.

                    This scene takes place in India, before Swami Vivekananda’s departure for America. Its significance
                    is that it shows the support, blessings, and hopes of his disciples as he set out on a historic

                    It suggests that his mission was not just personal but for humanity. His promise shows that he aimed

                    The speaker (Swami Vivekananda) presents Hinduism as a religion that teaches tolerance, acceptance,
                    and respect for all religions. It does not reject other faiths but embraces them as different paths

                    For many Americans, who lived in a largely Christian society, this message was new and inspiring. It
                    challenged narrow thinking but aligned with liberal values of freedom and equality, making them more
                    open to Hindu philosophy.

                    His training under Sri Ramakrishna, knowledge of scriptures, and experience of India’s diverse
                    culture prepared him. Challenges: unfamiliar culture, prejudice against non-Christian religions, and
