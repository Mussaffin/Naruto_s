                    Parasnath Hill is significant to Jains because it is associated with the Tirthankaras and Jain
                    principles like Ahimsa and Aparigraha. It is also important to the Santhal people and other tribes
                    who consider it spiritually valuable and live in harmony with the environment around it. This shows
                    India’s cultural diversity through the coexistence of different traditions.

                    Aastha faced physical challenges during the trek, such as climbing difficult paths and adjusting to
                    the environment. She overcame these with her mother’s support, curiosity to learn, and
                    determination.

                    Preserving natural and historical sites like Parasnath Hill is important to protect cultural
                    heritage and biodiversity. Such places teach us about history, religion, and the environment, and
                    inspire us to live responsibly and respectfully.
                    Before the journey, Aastha might have expected a simple trek. During the journey, she faced
                    challenges, learned about diverse cultures, and grew personally. Afterward, she gained a deeper
                    understanding of her state and society, making her experience far richer than expected.

                    Ahimsa means non-violence, and Aparigraha means non-attachment. In daily life, Ahimsa can be applied
                    by being kind to others, avoiding harm to animals, and using peaceful means to resolve conflicts.
                    Aparigraha can be followed by avoiding greed, living simply, and not becoming overly attached to
                    material possessions.

                    lush green forests and a variety of trees, making it a peaceful and refreshing environment. Aastha
