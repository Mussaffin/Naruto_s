                <li>
                    The passage suggests that the village had many basic needs, such as clothing for warmth food for the

                    This shows that the brush’s magic was pure and only responded to those with kind and selfless

            Answer the following questions:
        </h2>
        <h3>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>
                    Sanya’s discovery of the magical paintbrush allowed her to bring joy and help to her village. It
                    changed her life by giving her a purpose and transformed the village through solutions to real
                    problems like hunger and illness.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Rajaram was selfish and greedy. He tried to use the brush for his own gain, which caused the magic
                    to stop. His actions contrast with Sanya’s and reinforce the story’s message about the misuse of
                    power.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The main message is that selflessness, kindness, and imagination can transform lives. anya’s
                    journey—from discovering the brush to using it for the good of others—conveys this clearly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The story contrasts Sanya’s generosity with Rajaram’s greed. Sanya uses magic to help others, while
                    Rajaram fails because of his selfishness. This shows that good intentions matter more than power.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Initially, Sanya believed the brush alone held the magic. Over time, she realized the true magic was
                    her imagination, compassion, and ability to inspire others.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The story reflects real challenges like poverty, lack of food, clothing, and healthcare—common
                    issues in rural India. Sanya’s actions address these needs creatively and impassionately. Art and
                    creativity are shown as powerful tools for change. Sanya uses painting to solve problems, teach
                    children, and uplift the village, showing how creativity can transform society. Sanya’s actions led
                    to lasting improvements. She not only helped solve problems but also impowered others, especially
                    children, to create a better future for the village.
